    <h2>About the Place</h2>
    <p>Davao was but a small village consisted by various organized barangays. It was ruled by Datu Bago. This chieftain held his settlement near Davao River.

The first recorded attempt of the Spaniards to posses the place was when Don Jose Cruz de Uyanguren, native of Vergara, Guipuzcoa, Spain, together with other 70 men and women. Uyanguren, with his party, planned to defeat Datu Bago for them to get the place. As they were passing the narrow channel of the Davao River bend, their ship was outmaneuvered.  Three months later, still in the plot to dethrone the Datu and to subject the whole place to subjection, Datu Bago’s warriors attacked them which resulted to a battle. Few weeks after, Don Manuel Quesada, the Navy General of Zamboanga, arrived with a company of infantry and joined in the attack against Datu Bago’s settlement. When Datu Bago was defeated, they renamed the whole region as Nueva Guipuzcoa and founded the town Nueva Vergara, which is Davao now, in the year 1848. He became the first governor.</p>
